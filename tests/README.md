# OrderBook Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive unit tests for the OrderBook implementation using Google Test framework.

## Test Files

### `test_order.cpp`
Tests for the `Order` struct functionality:
- Order creation and initialization
- Order comparison operators (price-time priority)
- Copy and move semantics
- Equality operators

### `test_orderbook.cpp`
Basic OrderBook functionality tests:
- Order addition and removal
- Order cancellation and modification
- Basic order matching
- Book state queries
- Edge cases and error handling

### `orderbook_test.cpp`
**Comprehensive test suite** with 10 detailed test cases covering:

## Comprehensive Test Coverage

### 1. Basic Order Addition (`BasicOrderAddition`)
- Adding buy and sell orders to empty book
- Verifying best bid/ask prices
- Testing spread calculation
- Order count validation

### 2. Complete Order Matching (`CompleteOrderMatching`)
- Full order matching (both orders completely filled)
- Trade execution verification
- Order removal after matching
- Trade callback functionality

### 3. Partial Order Matching (`PartialOrderMatching`)
- Partial fills (one order fully filled, other partially)
- Remaining order quantity verification
- Trade execution details
- Book state after partial matching

### 4. Order Cancellation (`OrderCancellation`)
- Canceling orders from different price levels
- Best bid/ask updates after cancellation
- Non-existent order cancellation handling
- Book state consistency

### 5. Market Crossing Orders (`MarketCrossingOrders`)
- Aggressive orders that cross the spread
- Multi-level matching scenarios
- Trade price calculation (mid-price)
- Remaining order quantities after crossing

### 6. Empty Book Edge Cases (`EmptyBookEdgeCases`)
- Operations on empty order book
- Query methods on empty book
- Cancellation/modification attempts on empty book
- Book clearing functionality

### 7. Multi-Level Matching (`MultiLevelMatching`)
- Large orders matching multiple price levels
- Sequential trade execution
- Complex matching scenarios
- Remaining order calculations

### 8. Price-Time Priority (`PriceTimePriority`)
- FIFO enforcement at same price level
- Timestamp-based order matching
- Priority queue behavior
- Fair matching order

### 9. Invalid Input Handling (`InvalidInputHandling`)
- Null order rejection
- Zero quantity order handling
- Duplicate order ID prevention
- Non-existent order operations

### 10. Order Modification (`OrderModification`)
- Price and quantity updates
- Book state updates after modification
- Modification triggering matches
- Order re-positioning in price levels

## Test Execution

### Run All Tests
```bash
# Build and run all tests
./build.sh

# Or manually:
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
./orderbook_tests                    # Basic tests
./orderbook_comprehensive_tests      # Comprehensive tests
```

### Run Specific Tests
```bash
# Run only comprehensive tests
./orderbook_comprehensive_tests

# Run with verbose output
./orderbook_comprehensive_tests --gtest_verbose

# Run specific test case
./orderbook_comprehensive_tests --gtest_filter="OrderBookComprehensiveTest.BasicOrderAddition"
```

## Test Design Principles

### 1. **Isolation**
- Each test is independent and can run in any order
- Fresh OrderBook instance for each test
- Proper setup and teardown

### 2. **Comprehensive Coverage**
- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Performance-critical paths
- Memory management validation

### 3. **Real-world Scenarios**
- Market crossing orders
- Partial fills
- Multi-level matching
- Price-time priority enforcement

### 4. **Assertion Quality**
- Clear, descriptive test names
- Specific assertions with meaningful messages
- State verification after each operation
- Trade execution validation

## Performance Considerations

The tests include scenarios that validate:
- O(log n) insertion performance
- Efficient order lookup and cancellation
- Memory usage patterns
- Trade execution speed

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines:
- No external dependencies (except Google Test)
- Deterministic results
- Fast execution time
- Clear pass/fail indicators

## Adding New Tests

When adding new test cases:

1. **Follow naming convention**: `TestCategory_Description`
2. **Use descriptive names**: Clearly indicate what is being tested
3. **Include setup/teardown**: Ensure test isolation
4. **Verify state changes**: Check both positive and negative outcomes
5. **Document complex scenarios**: Add comments for non-obvious test logic

## Test Metrics

Current test coverage:
- **10 comprehensive test cases**
- **50+ individual assertions**
- **All core OrderBook functionality**
- **Edge cases and error handling**
- **Performance-critical paths**

The test suite provides confidence in the OrderBook implementation's correctness, robustness, and performance characteristics.
